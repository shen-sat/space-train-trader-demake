- cart management aspect is missing a bit, so only sell specific carts to specific planets
	- instantiate different planets with different types (and colors)
		- make a make_planet method -- DONE
		- give planets a type attr -- DONE
		- make a planet_types table ('gold', 'ruby') -- DONE
		- make a new planet
			- add attr color as an arg
			- make its color change dependent on its own type
	- instantiate different carts with different types (and colors)
	- only sell carts at planets of same type (*let's see how the other carts' movements react hehe*)

Re-emphasising MVP:
- finite fuel
- two different planets
 - compass for planets
- two different cart types
	- one cart sells for more than the other, but fewer of them
	- more expensive cart provides bigger boost
- get to 1000 credits

epics:
- make carts move next to each other and engine, regardless of speed
- map with borders
- randomly spawn carts and planets, with player in center
- win condition
- lose condition
- intro

interesting stuff:
- you "discover" combos of carts, like Link discovering recipes in BOTW

done:
- move player with right/left arrows
- speed variable
- fuel counter
- instantiate cart object
- add carts attribute to engine
- add collision - if collide add cart to engine carts
- collect carts
- move collected carts
- change engine speed with fuel carts
- brake for engine
- sell carts at planet
