- cart management aspect is missing a bit, so only sell specific carts to specific planets
	- add type attribute to planet
	- instantiate different planets with different types (and colors)
	- instantiate different carts with different types (and colors)
	- only sell carts at planets of same type (*let's see how the other carts' movements reac hehe*)

epics:
- make carts move next to each other and engine, regardless of speed
- map with borders
- randomly spawn carts and planets, with player in center
- win condition
- lose condition
- intro

interesting stuff:
- you "discover" combos of carts, like Link discovering recipes in BOTW

done:
- move player with right/left arrows
- speed variable
- fuel counter
- instantiate cart object
- add carts attribute to engine
- add collision - if collide add cart to engine carts
- collect carts
- move collected carts
- change engine speed with fuel carts
- brake for engine
- sell carts at planet
